## What is does this adaptation of Insites Cookie Consent do? 

Lets start by looking at what Cookie Consent by Insites actually is...

[Cookie Consent](https://cookieconsent.insites.com/) is a lightweight JavaScript plugin developed by Insites for alerting users about the use of cookies on your website.

It is designed to help you comply with the EU's GDPR regulations, but out of the box it misses the mark with a true revokable consent. It also forces you to implement that EU compliance across the board putting valuable tracking data at risk in countries that do not require this compliance.

I have taken the initial work done by Insites and adapted if for a better GDPR implementation. As I commit and ask for community feedback, this repository will also evolve in to something thats hopefully useful to people trying to comply.

I am not a lawyer, nor is this legal advice in any way shape or form. This is merely my take, based on the GDPR rules, of a cookie consent that satisfies the GDPR's need for the ability to allow true opt-in with the ability to change that choice in perpetuity for users visiting your site from the EU. It will also counter that functionality with a more informational version of the consent for all countries outside of the EU.

More info and documentation coming soon...
